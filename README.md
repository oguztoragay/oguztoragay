- 👋 Hi, I’m Oguz Toragay
- 👀 I’m interested in application of optimization (almost in any type) to solve engineering problems. 
- 🌱 I’m currently using Pyomo (Python Optimization Modeling Object) for my projects
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Mathematical modeling, Heuristic, and Metaheuristic approaches to solve structural optimization problems specifically topology optimizations for lightweight frame structures for additive manufacturing.
